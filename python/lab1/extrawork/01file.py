# wap to create a class shape that has the following members
# data member:
# length
# breadth
# radius
# type

# Member function :
# A default parameterized constructor in which we pass all the values and initailize all data members accordingly
# A function computerArea that will calculate area and display it on basis of following conditions
# Type              - Area
# "Rectangle"   - length * breadth
# "Circle"          - 3.14 * radius * radius

# 	Inherit shape class into rectangle class & circle 
# but it has no members
# create one object of rectangle class but passed only length & breadth and call computerArea()
# Same done for Circle class but passed only radius.
